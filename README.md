Pilbox
======

Pilbox is an image resizing application built on Python's [Tornado web framework](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) using the [Python Imaging Library (PIL)](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/). It is not intended to be the primary source of images, but instead acts as a proxy which requests images, resizes them to the desired size and optionally stores the resized version.
